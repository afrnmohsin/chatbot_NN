# Features
Neural network with two hidden layers and dropout for regularization.
Uses categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
Trains on preprocessed data for 200 epochs.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
Required libraries for data preprocessing (included in data_preprocessing.py)
